# ElectricityBillingSystem
College 3rd Semester Advanced Programming Practices
# Abstract
Electricity consumers are often faced with the problem of inaccuracy and delay 
in monthly billing due to the drawback in reading pattern and human errors. 
Thus, it is essential to have an efficient system for such purposes via electronic 
platform with consideration to proximity. The proposed system automates the 
conventional process of paying electricity bill by visiting the Electricity Board 
which is tiresome and time consuming. It is also designed to automate the 
electricity bill calculation and payment for user convenience. The system is 
developed with Apache Netbeans IDE and Java as the base programming
language which can be used to develop websites, web applications and web 
services. The Microsoft Structured Query Language (SQL) server is also used 
for creating back-end database. The system would be having two logins: the 
admin and user login. The administrator can create or view the user’s account 
details and can add or update the customer’s information of consuming units of 
energy of the current month in their account. The Admin has to feed the system 
with the electricity usage data into respective users account. The system then 
calculates the electricity bill for every user and updates the information into 
their account every month. Users can then view their electricity bill and pay 
before the month end.
